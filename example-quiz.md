## Variables and Data Types

In many programming languages, variables are used to store data values.

**What is the primary purpose of a variable in programming?**

A. To display output to the user
B. To store data that can be referenced and manipulated
C. To define the structure of a program
D. To handle user input only

> Correct Answer: B. To store data that can be referenced and manipulated
> Overall Feedback: Variables act as containers for storing data values that can be changed during program execution.

## Control Flow: Conditionals

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
else:
    grade = "C"

print(grade)
```

**What will be printed when this code runs?**

A. A
B. B
C. C
D. Error

> Correct Answer: B. B
> Overall Feedback: The score is 85, which is >= 80 but < 90, so the `elif score >= 80` condition is met and grade is set to "B".

## Functions and Scope

**Short Answer Question:**

What keyword is used in Python to define a reusable block of code that can accept parameters and return values?

> Correct Answer: def
> Overall Feedback: The `def` keyword is used to define a function in Python.

## Data Structures: Lists

Which of the following are valid operations you can perform on a Python list? (Select all that apply)

A. Append elements to the end
B. Access elements by index
C. Remove elements by value
D. Sort elements in place

> Correct Answers: A, B, C, D
> Overall Feedback: All of these are valid list operations in Python. Lists are mutable sequences that support appending, indexing, removing, and sorting.

## Error Handling

When writing robust programs, it's important to handle potential errors gracefully.

**Which approach is recommended for handling potential errors in Python?**

A. Let the program crash and display the error
B. Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions
C. Avoid writing code that might cause errors
D. Only handle errors in production code

> Correct Answer: B. Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions
> Overall Feedback: Python's try-except mechanism allows developers to catch anticipated errors and handle them gracefully without crashing the program.
